# Housing Price Prediction - MLOps Project

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a complete MLOps setup for a housing price prediction model. It integrates MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, alongside MinIO for artifact storage.

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.11** - Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library for model development
- **MLflow** - Experiment tracking, model versioning, and registry
- **MinIO** - S3-compatible object storage for models and artifacts
- **Docker** - Containerization for reproducibility
- **Jupyter** - Interactive development and visualization

## MLOps Implementation
This project follows MLOps best practices with:
- **Data Versioning**: Housing data is stored in MinIO with version control.
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow logs all model training runs.
- **Model Registry**: Trained models are stored and versioned in MLflow.
- **Reproducible Environment**: Docker ensures a consistent setup for development and deployment.

## Getting Started
### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Services with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Access Services
